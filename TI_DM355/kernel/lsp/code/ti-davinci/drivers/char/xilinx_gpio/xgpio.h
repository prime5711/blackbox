*
* This file contains the software API definition of the Xilinx General Purpose
* I/O (XGpio) device driver component.
*
* The Xilinx GPIO controller is a soft IP core designed for Xilinx FPGAs on
* the OPB or PLB bus and contains the following general features:
*   - Support for up to 32 I/O discretes for each channel (64 bits total).
*   - Each of the discretes can be configured for input or output.
*   - Configurable support for dual channels and interrupt generation.
*
* The driver provides interrupt management functions. Implementation of
* interrupt handlers is left to the user. Refer to the provided interrupt
* example in the examples directory for details.
*
* This driver is intended to be RTOS and processor independent. Any needs for
* dynamic memory management, threads or thread mutual exclusion, virtual
* memory, or cache control must be satisfied by the layer above this driver.
*
* <b>Initialization & Configuration</b>
*
* The XGpio_Config structure is used by the driver to configure itself. This
* configuration structure is typically created by the tool-chain based on HW
* build properties.
*
* To support multiple runtime loading and initialization strategies employed
* by various operating systems, the driver instance can be initialized in one
* of the following ways:
*
*   - XGpio_Initialize(InstancePtr, DeviceId) - The driver looks up its own
*     configuration structure created by the tool-chain based on an ID provided
*     by the tool-chain.
*
*   - XGpio_CfgInitialize(InstancePtr, CfgPtr, EffectiveAddr) - Uses a
*     configuration structure provided by the caller. If running in a system
*     with address translation, the provided virtual memory base address
*     replaces the physical address present in the configuration structure.
*
* @note
*
* This API utilizes 32 bit I/O to the GPIO registers. With less than 32 bits,
* the unused bits from registers are read as zero and written as don't cares.
*
* <pre>
* MODIFICATION HISTORY:
*
* Ver   Who  Date     Changes
* ----- ---- -------- -----------------------------------------------
* 1.00a rmm  03/13/02 First release
* 2.00a jhl  11/26/03 Added support for dual channels and interrupts
* 2.01a jvb  12/14/05 I separated dependency on the static config table and
*                     xparameters.h from the driver initialization by moving
*                     _Initialize and _LookupConfig to _sinit.c. I also added
*                     the new _CfgInitialize routine.
