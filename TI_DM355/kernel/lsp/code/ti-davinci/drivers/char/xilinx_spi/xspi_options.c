* @param    Options contains the specified options to be set. This is a bit
*           mask where a 1 means to turn the option on, and a 0 means to turn
*           the option off. One or more bit values may be contained in the mask.

* - XST_DEVICE_BUSY if the device is currently transferring data. The transfer
*   must complete or be aborted before setting options.
* - XST_SPI_SLAVE_ONLY if the caller attempted to configure a slave-only
*   device as a master.
*
* @note
*
* This function makes use of internal resources that are shared between the
* XSpi_Stop() and XSpi_SetOptions() functions. So if one task might be setting
* device options options while another is trying to stop the device, the user
* is required to provide protection of this shared data (typically using a
