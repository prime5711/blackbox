config I2C_ALGOBIT
	tristate "I2C bit-banging interfaces"
	depends on I2C
	help
	  This allows you to use a range of I2C adapters called bit-banging
	  adapters.  Say Y if you own an I2C adapter belonging to this class
	  and then say Y to the specific driver for you adapter below.

	  This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module 
	  will be called i2c-algo-bit.

config I2C_ALGOPCF
	tristate "I2C PCF 8584 interfaces"
	depends on I2C
	help
	  This allows you to use a range of I2C adapters called PCF adapters.
	  Say Y if you own an I2C adapter belonging to this class and then say
	  Y to the specific driver for you adapter below.

	  This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module 
	  will be called i2c-algo-pcf.

config I2C_ALGOPCA
	tristate "I2C PCA 9564 interfaces"
	depends on I2C
	help
	  This allows you to use a range of I2C adapters called PCA adapters.
	  Say Y if you own an I2C adapter belonging to this class and then say
	  Y to the specific driver for you adapter below.

	  This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module 
	  will be called i2c-algo-pca.

config I2C_ALGOPALM
	tristate "PalmChip's I2C interfaces"
	depends on I2C
	help
	  This allows you to use the BK3220 I2C Host Adapter on the RMI Phoenix.
	  This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called i2c-algo-palm.

config I2C_ALGOITE
	tristate "ITE I2C Algorithm"
	depends on MIPS_ITE8172 && I2C
	help
	  This supports the use of the ITE8172 I2C interface found on some MIPS
	  systems. Say Y if you have one of these. You should also say Y for
	  the ITE I2C peripheral driver support below.

	  This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module 
	  will be called i2c-algo-ite.

config I2C_ALGO8XX
	tristate "MPC8xx CPM I2C interface"
	depends on 8xx && I2C

config I2C_ALGO_SIBYTE
	tristate "SiByte SMBus interface"
	depends on SIBYTE_SB1xxx_SOC && I2C
	help
	  Supports the SiByte SOC on-chip I2C interfaces (2 channels).

config I2C_ALGO_SGI
	tristate "I2C SGI interfaces"
	depends on I2C
	help
	  Supports the SGI interfaces like the ones found on SGI Indy VINO
	  or SGI O2 MACE.

config I2C_ALGO_XILINX
	tristate "I2C IP from Xilinx EDK"
	depends on XILINX_VIRTEX && I2C
	select XILINX_EDK
	help
	  Supports I2C IP from Xilinx EDK.

config I2C_ALGO_EMMA2RH
	tristate "I2C EMMA2RH interfaces"
	depends on I2C && MARKEINS
	help
	  NEC EMMA2RH I2C Algorithm
